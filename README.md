# Covid Stats Project

In my final year in college I finished my last semster during covid and was also in statistics class. 
For my project I was curious to compare some of the projection models for covid and to see how close the numbers were
after that time has past. 

Utilized python and matplotlib to graph data of projection models and the true numbers after the time period. 

My assesment is in the [covidreport](https://github.com/schattz/Statsproject/blob/master/covidreport.pdf). 

Disclamier I am not a medical expert or statistic and found intrest in the subject.
