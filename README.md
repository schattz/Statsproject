# COVID Stats Project

In my final year of college, I completed my last semester during COVID and was also in a statistics class. For my project, I was curious to compare some of the projection models for COVID and see how close the numbers were after some time had passed.

I utilized Python and Matplotlib to graph the data from the projection models against the actual numbers after the time period.

My assessment can be found in the [covidreport](https://github.com/schattz/Statsproject/blob/master/covidreport.pdf).

Disclaimer: I am not a medical or statistical expert, but I have found interest in the subject.
